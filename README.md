## Pillbug

This is a neural-network project that will be trained to break down PDFs into smaller chunks. Used to help people better concentrate on reading. It's in its early stages now -- currently, I am working on the page formatting.

Start-up code by [Traversy Media](https://youtu.be/ydCSSgwZjzs).
